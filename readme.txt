MZ Mindbody API uses the Devin Crossman API to interface with MindBodyOnline and display Staff, Schedule and Workshops.


== Description ==

MZ Mindbody API uses the Devin Crossman API to interface with MindBodyOnline and display Staff, Schedule and Workshops.

Two important requirements are:

    1. PEAR and SOAP must be installed/enabled on the web server
    2. MindBodyOnline API Developer Account

(PHP 5.2 compliant.)

== Installation ==

Steps to install and configure MZ Mindbody API:

1. Upload the directory, `mz_mindbody_api` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Follow instructions at [mZoo.org](http://www.mzoo.org/creating-your-mindbody-credentials).
4. In the WP Admin panel go to: Settings -> MZ Mindbody and configure settings
5. This plugin includes some minimal CSS which you can override in theme.
6. Also includes some bootstrap css so check there if conflicts arise.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= One of the elements I need to fill is are the *Event IDs*. Can you help me learn where to find those? =

I'm not sure if there's an easier way, but you can find them by, within MindBody,
going to an Event EDIT page and viewing the source of the Dropdown menu items, which
contain the name of each event type and it's associated ID number.

== Why am I getting "Permission denied" and "Invalid Argument" errors? ==

You need to register a developer account with MindBody, which costs $5+ per website. Follow the instructions at [mZoo.org](http://www.mzoo.org/creating-your-mindbody-credentials).

== Notes ==

This is not a terribly easy plugin to install. 
Configuring the server may require input from your web hosting company (or you might get lucky).
And getting all the MindBody details configured can also be a little laborious.
Also mindbody is charging developers $5 per month per account connection now.
