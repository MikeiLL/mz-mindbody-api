# MZ Mindbody API

Extensible, template-based Wordpress plugin to interface with Mindbody API.

## Development

Currently using Yarn to manage assets, and composer to manage dependencies.

 * `composer install`
 * `yarn install` (webpack, etc...)
 * Commands to compile and watch with yarn are in `package.json`:
    `yarn prod`
    `yarn dev`
    `yarn watch`
 * Works with `npm v12`.
