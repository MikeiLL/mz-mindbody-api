== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= One of the elements I need to fill out are the *Event IDs*. Can you help me learn where to find those? =

I'm not sure if there's an easier way, but you can find them by, within MindBody,
going to an Event EDIT page and viewing the source of the Dropdown menu items, which
contain the name of each event type and it's associated ID number.

== Why am I getting "Permission denied" and "Invalid Argument" errors? ==

You need to register a developer account with MindBody, which costs $5+ per website. Follow the instructions at [mZoo.org](http://www.mzoo.org/creating-your-mindbody-credentials).
